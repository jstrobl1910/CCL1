## What Went Well  
- **Level Design:** Designing and testing levels was both fun and rewarding, adding depth to the gameplay.  
- **Mouse Click Movement:** Implementing movement based on mouse clicks worked surprisingly well with the right math.  

## Challenges  
- **Gravity & Movement:** Balancing gravity with smooth movement was tricky. Adjusting `xVelocity` and `yVelocity` was necessary for better control.  
- **Collision Handling:** The `applyGravity` function originally only checked for top and bottom collisions, so I had to add horizontal collision detection.  

## Lessons Learned  
- **Understand Core Functions First:** Fully understanding how `applyGravity` worked was crucial for avoiding unexpected behavior.  
- **Keep It Simple:** At times, I overcomplicated the physics, but a simpler approach often gave the best results.
