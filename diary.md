# Game Development Diary

## Day 1: Initial Setup and Planning
- **Discussed** the game idea with the lecturer to clarify objectives.
- **Began designing** the level layout to establish the game environment.
- **Started implementing** ball movement based on mouse click coordinates.

## Day 2: Enhancing Ball Movement
- **Developed** variable speed for the ball depending on the distance from the mouse click.
- **Implemented** collision detection between the ball and the canvas boundaries to prevent it from moving off-screen.

## Day 3: Refining Physics Mechanics
- **Added** speed decay to gradually slow down the ball after a stroke, ensuring realistic motion.
- **Began working** on the hole mechanism to serve as the gameâ€™s primary objective.
- **Modified** the `applyGravity` function to enable collision with the hole.

## Day 4: Introducing Dynamic Obstacles
- **Implemented** moving obstacles to increase game difficulty and add dynamic challenges for players.

## Day 5: Polishing and Expanding Features
- **Refined** the game's physics and controls for smoother and more responsive gameplay.
- **Added** a new obstacle, the waterpit, which restarts the level upon collision.
- **Created** a system to automatically start new levels once the current level is completed.

## Day 6: Level Management and Expansion
- **Designed and implemented** an entirely new level to expand game content.
- **Developed** `level.js` to manage different levels, ensuring seamless transitions and automatic level progression.

## Day 7: Graphics and Animation Development
- **Began drawing** the ball with sprite-based animations using a spritesheet.
- **Created** animated grass and waterpit elements to enhance visual appeal.

## Day 8: Creating Start and End Screens
- **Designed** the start screen with a welcoming message and a "Start Game" button.
- **Developed** the end screen with a "Play Again" button.
- **Implemented** navigation logic to transition between the start screen, gameplay, and end screen.
- **Added** an option to play again after completing the levels.
